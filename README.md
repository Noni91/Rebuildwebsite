    <h1> National Chicken Wing Day </h1>
 
<p> 
Today is National Chicken Wing Day! Over the years, chicken wings have become a commonplace menu item at many chain and local restaurants. With franchises such as Buffalo Wild Wings, Wingstop and Atomic Wings, you can’t go far without finding somewhere to get delicious wings. One of the most popular varieties of wings is most certainly buffalo style (with bleu cheese, of course!). Other popular varieties include barbecue, lemon pepper, parmesan garlic, sweet and sour, and honey mustard.
 
Did you know that the name comes from this spicy wing’s origination? The city of Buffalo, NY was the birthplace of the spicy wings we all know and love. Legend has it that Teressa Bellissimo created this popular party snack at the Anchor Bar, which she owned with her husband Frank. One night, her son and some of his college buddies decided they wanted a late night bite. Teressa thought up this fast and easy dish as she deep friend some chicken wings and tossed them in a combination of butter and hot sauce. They were a hit!
 
July 29th was officially proclaimed as National Chicken Wing Day by Buffalo mayor Stan Makowski in 1997. Today, round up your friends at your favorite restaurant or sports bar and order some chicken wings! Find even more ways to celebrate at www.nationalchickenwingday.com.
